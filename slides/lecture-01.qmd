For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

—Lewis C. Carol, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

"If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't. And contrary wise, what is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would. You see?"

—Alice, from Disney's *Alice in Wonderland*

**Empirical research**

- **Empirical** = data

- Learning about the Universe through data and observation.

Find out about the etymology of *empirical*!


**The two axes of reseach type**

- Exploratory vs corroboratoy.

- Descriptive vs explanatory.

**Three types of research objectives**


**Establish facts**

- Fill a gap in knowledge.
- Accumulate evidence.


**Improve fit of framework to facts**


**Compare fit of different frameworks to facts**


**Three types of research objectives** (examples)


**Establish facts**

- What are the uses of the Sanskrit verb *gam* 'to go'.


**Improve fit of framework to facts**

- Strong exemplar-based models preclude the possibility of abstract representations, but certain categorisation tasks seem to involve abstract representations so these must be included in exemplar-based models.


**Compare fit of different frameworks to facts**

- There are two possible models for the bilingual lexicon: Word association and concept mediation. Which one better describes and explains the data?


**Research context** (Ellis and Levy 2008)

![](../../img/research-topic.png)


**Research question**

- Research questions are **testable questions** whose answers directly address the problem.


**Research hypothesis**

- Research hypotheses are **statements** (not questions) about the research problem.

- Hypotheses must be **falsifiable** (there can be in principle an outcome that shows them to be false).

- Hypotheses are never true nor confirmed. We can only **corroborate** hypothesis, and it's a long term process.

## Data analysis


![](../../img/data-quant-qual.png)


![](../../img/data-quant.png)


The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning.

— Nate Silver, *The Signal and the Noise*

## Inference process

???

Imbuing numbers with meaning is a good characterisation of the "inference process".

We have a question about something.

Let's imagine that this something is the population of British Sign Language signers.

We want to know whether the cultural background of the BSL signers is linked to different pragmatic uses of the sign for BROTHER.

But we can't survey the entire population of BSL signers.

NOTE: *Population* can be a set of anything, not just a specific group of people. For example, the words in a dictionary can be a "population"; or the antipassive constructions of Austronesian languages; or ...

## Inference process


![](../../img/inference.png)
]

???

We take a **sample** from the population.

This is our empirical data (the product of observation).

How do we go from data/observation to answering our question?

We can use **inference**.

**Inference** is the process of understanding something about a population based on the sample (aka the data) taken from that population.

class: middle center inverse

## Inference is not infallible

???

However, inference based on data does not guarantee that the answers to our questions are right/true.

In fact, any observation we make comes with a degree of **uncertainty and variability**.

EXTRA: Find out about Popper's view of falsification and fallibilism.

## Uncertainty and variability


![](../../img/pliny.jpg)

???

So we have to deal with:

- Uncertainty in any observation of a phenomenon.

- Variability among different observations of the same phenomenon.

class: center, middle, inverse

![](../../img/uncertainty.png)

???

Guess what it is...

# *Statistics* as a tool to deal with *uncertainty* and *variability*



Statistics helps us quantifying uncertainty and controlling for variability.

## What is statistics?


Statistics is the **science** concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. (From [UCI Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.uci.edu/what-is-statistics/))




Statistics is the **technology** of extracting information, illumination and understanding from data, often in the face of uncertainty. (From the [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/blog/what-is-statistics/))



Statistics is a **mathematical and conceptual** discipline that focuses on the relation between data and hypotheses. (From the [Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/))



Statistics as the **art** of applying the science of scientific methods. (From [ORI Results](https://www.oriresults.com/articles/blog-posts/the-art-of-statistics/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00898-0))


*Statistic is both a science and an art*.

It is a *science* in that its methods are basically systematic and have general application and an *art* in that their successful application depends, to a considerable degree, on the skill and special experience of the statistician, and on his knowledge of the field of application.

—L. H. C. Tippett

## What statistics is NOT

- Statistics is **not maths.**

- Statistics is **not about hard truths.**

- Statistics is **not a purely objective** endeavour.

- Statistics is **not a substitute** of common sense and expert knowledge.

- Statistics is **not just $p$-values** and significance testing.




## Many Analysts, One Data Set

![](../../img/red-card.jpg)

**Is there a link between player skin tone and number of red cards in soccer?**

- **29 independent analysis teams**.

- 69% of the teams reported an effect, and 31% did not.

- **21 unique** types of statistical analysis.


> The observed results from analyzing a complex data set can be highly contingent on **justifiable**, but **subjective**, analytic decisions.

—Silberzahn et al 2018


![](../../img/forking-paths.png)


**Do speakers acoustically modify utterances to signal atypical word combinations?**

- **30 independent analysis teams** (84 signed up, 46 submitted an analysis, 30 submitted usable analyses).
- **109** individual analyses.
- **52** unique measurement specifications, **47** unique model specifications.

> Nine teams out of the thirty (30%) reported to have found at least one statistically reliable effect (based on the inferential criteria they specified). Of the 170 critical model coefficients, 37 were claimed to show a statistically reliable effect (21.8%).

—Coretta et al, 2023
