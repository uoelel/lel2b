## Types of research objectives

- **Establish facts**
  - Fill a gap in knowledge.
  - Accumulate evidence.

- **Improve fit of framework to facts**
  - Improve how well a framework can describe and explain a phenomenon.

- **Compare fit of different frameworks to facts**
  - Compare opposing hypotheses generated by two or more frameworks.

## Types of research objectives: examples

**Establish facts**

- What are the uses of the Sanskrit verb *gam* 'to go'.

**Improve fit of framework to facts**

- Strong exemplar-based models preclude the possibility of abstract representations.
- You run a study that assess whether abstract representations cam be formed.
- The results indicate that certain categorisation tasks seem to involve abstract representations.
- So we update our exemplar-based framework to include abstractions.

## Research question and hypotheses

**Research question**

- Research questions are **testable questions** whose answers directly address the problem.

**Research hypothesis**

- Research hypotheses are **statements** (not questions) about the research problem.

- Hypotheses must be **falsifiable** (there can be in principle an outcome that shows them to be false).

- Hypotheses are never true nor confirmed. We can only **corroborate** hypothesis, and it's a long term process.
