## What is empirical research?

**Empirical research**

-   **Empirical** = data

-   Learning about the Universe through data and observation.

Find out about the etymology of *empirical* in your own time!

## Axes of research types

**The two axes of research type**

-   Exploratory vs corroboratoy.

-   Descriptive vs explanatory.

## Types of research objectives

-   **Establish facts**
    -   Fill a gap in knowledge.
    -   Accumulate evidence.
-   **Improve fit of framework to facts**
    -   Improve how well a framework can describe and explain a phenomenon.
-   **Compare fit of different frameworks to facts**
    -   Compare opposing hypotheses generated by two or more frameworks.

## Types of research objectives: examples

**Establish facts**

-   What are the uses of the Sanskrit verb *gam* 'to go'.

**Improve fit of framework to facts**

-   Strong exemplar-based models preclude the possibility of abstract representations.
-   If the results of a study indicate that certain categorisation tasks seem to involve abstract representations, we update our exemplar-based framework to include abstractions.

**Compare fit of different frameworks to facts**

-   In the sentence "Stefano emailed Bert. I saw *him* in DSB.", the subjecthood hypothesis states that *him* refers to *Stefano*, while under the "syntactic parallelism" hypothesis *him* refers to *Bert*.
-   We test these hypotheses using empirical data.

## Research question and hypotheses

**Research question**

-   Research questions are **testable questions** whose answers directly address the problem.

**Research hypothesis**

-   Research hypotheses are **statements** (not questions) about the research problem.

-   Hypotheses must be **falsifiable** (there can be in principle an outcome that shows them to be false).

    -   A falsifiable hypothesis cannot include "may, could, might, in certain contexts" or any other vague expression!

-   Hypotheses are never true nor confirmed. We can only **corroborate** hypothesis, and it's a long term process.

## Research question and hypotheses: examples

**Research questions**

-   What are the pragmatic uses of *bro* in the LGBTQ+ community?
-   How do British Sign Language users mark evidentiality?
-   Why do vowels tend to be shorter before voiceless consonants and longer before voiced ones?

**Research hypotheses**

-   Demoted subjects cannot be placed in focus positions.
-   High vowels are shorter than low vowels.
-   Lexical change is driven by young female speakers in the working class but by old male speakers in the middle and upper classes.
